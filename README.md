# Collaboration - EQ - Leadership

This repository is to help me track resources for learning better collaboration and leadership skills. 

Software engineering is hard: https://youtu.be/baE6CzzoCL8

- Techno-complexity:
1.  tech abstraction 
2. organizational (navigating with the right people) 
 	-  Getting alignment can be more challenging than building code
 	- metrics, logging, selling, prototyping, EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY
 	- multiplying impact: documentation, mentoring
 3. Ambiguity: What? Scope? Timeline? Budget? Good solution?
	- prototypes
	- research
	- examples
	- share findings
	- CRAFT A ROADMAP
4. Leadership
	- not controlling/faking confidence
	- INITIATIVE: bringing improvements proactively
	- PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT NEEDS DONE
	- attitude
	- Drive a project
	- Right ideas, set meetings, delegate(?)
	- Build a project around a pain point
	- Good leader identifies opportunities 
5. Impact
	- Effort is appreciated; impact is useful 
	- Take ownership, address roadblocks
Avoid "Shiny Object" preference; 
- TAKE THE TEAM TO COMPLETION WITH A PROJECT
- No impact of "technically interesting" prototyping with a new tech
- INTERFACE with the business side of things
- Tech complexity is 1 small facet of the job 

Collaborating at Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmwmg4pwdBc
1. Be optimistic
	Be generous - prepared to invest in relationship
	Be forgiving 
2. Know yourself, Assertive <-> Cooperative: What should I try? 
3. Prompts: how do we dress? how should we behave? Small self-signaling tool! 
4. Generosity: time, information, attention, etc.
"Deposits in emotional bank accts!"
TONE: Be bright, but not condescending
	Positive, generous tone
	Keep that "feel" for the other human being in email
5. Analytical: 
	Not all work is worth the investment; what's the payoff?
	Think about an prioritize relationships
	
Cultivating collaboration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjSTNv4gyMM
- "star performers" sometimes sabotage others
- teaching collaboration in "red zone" environments improved quality! 
- BE LESS DEFENSIVE! 
- Green to red zone can happen quickly; unconscious 
- Fears about significance, competence, and likeability
- Defensiveness helps us hide our fears from ourselves 
- What are my signs of defensiveness:
	- early warning alarm bells
	- "flooding with information to prove a point!"
	- Acknowledge defensiveness
	- Slow down physiology
	- Self talk: GO POSITIVE
	- Action Step: BE QUIET for a bit
	- PRACTICE IT!

Value of Humor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdZAMSyn_As
- People think humor is a nice-to-have; it's a must-have
- BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER! 
- Humor is a skill
- Use perspective to connect with other people
- "Yes, and..." works for life! have more fun
- Reflection on the past leads to action in the future
